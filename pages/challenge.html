    <p class="text-gray-700 text-md mb-8">
        This challenge seeks to investigate the few-shot generalisation properties of foundation models
        in the context of real-world brain MRI data by evaluating models on <span class="font-bold">three large
            clinical, multi-vendor, and multi-center datasets.</span> The concept is to evaluate <i>the same</i>
        pretrained models on multiple downstream
        tasks, to understand the effects of different pre-training paradigms and configurations on
        downstream performance and ultimately both identify the most promising methodologies and quantify the benefits
        of self-supervised pre-training.
